##  âš¡ Fun Fact

Did you know that cats are excellent coders? They love to sit on keyboards and help their owners write code. In fact, there are even coding languages named after cats, like the programming language "CAT" and the scripting language "Feline." If you're ever feeling stuck on a coding problem, just ask your cat for help!
